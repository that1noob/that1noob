Yoo, I'm Ronald!

Iâ€™m currently learning:
  * How to use GitHub :^)
  * NodeJS to make a Discord bot
  * C++ for school
  * Unity Engine and might go to Unreal Engine
  * Blender
  * Embedded hardware
  
Projects I want to start making:
  * A Discord bot
  * A twitter bot, if YilonMa won't butcher it.
  * A simple game
  
I have no idea what you are doing on my GitHub, but feel free to look at my awesome repositories that are totally there and cool and stuff :^)
